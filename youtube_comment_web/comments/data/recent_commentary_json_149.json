He is the previous winner, and in the beginning she seems shocked and a little afraid when Luka spins her around and she can't avoid his gaze. She sees nothing there in terms of emotion. He might as well be another alien, with the way he powers through the song almost effortlessly. No regard for her mourning, his fellow trapped humans, no goals or aspirations outside of pleasing his masters. He is the opposite of playful, rule breaking Sua.

To support this, we know Lukas is a very calculated person, a solved rubik's cube in round 3 and his interview highlighting that he prepared ahead for unexpected outcomes.

I kept having the impression that Luka was saying \\\"This is how you play the game\\\" to Mizi the whole time. I felt like he's deliberately trying to make Mizi sees Sua in him as if saying that \\\"You have your weakness written all over your face\\\" and proceeds to show you just how that weakness could be used against her, and by the time Mizi lose her control, he already made his point.

The melody comes off as romantic and wistful (keep this in mind.) We skip over to the 5th round and see Mizi being introduced to the stage again and the music picks up and the romantic tones stay but the wistful times are taken away and replace with suductive and flirty tones (remember this). We can already see Mizi is still emotionally distraught over the loss of her love Sua. We have no idea how much time has past, but maybe we can assume that it is at least a day later, since later on we see Till wearing the same outfit from his previous performance (we can chock that up to Till just being a stinky boy) but he now has a bandage and he isn't being muzzled up anymore + Mizi has changed outfits along with luka too since he was also wearing something different for the 4th round. Anyway Mizi and Luka walk across the stage they are both wearing white with long ribbon/bows somewhere on there outfit. It is obvious they are supposed to look like a pairing. (Who picks the outfits and the song?) If Mizi picked her own outfits which I have trouble believing she did since she is so out of it in the performance, but if she did it was probably a tribut to Sua since she also wore white on their performance. But if Mizi didn't pick it then I feel it might have something to do with Luka's bigger plan. Luka smiles as the crowd cheers him onto the stage. Suddenly Luka gets very close to Mizi out of nowhere and it startles her she has a shocked face but Luka \\\"expresses\\\" multiple faces. If you slow the video down you can see as he's coming up has an almost pitying look towards Mizi. Then it changes to a neutral gaze looking directly in her eyes. Mizi immediately turns around walking away and you can see she looks uncomfortable. And this causes Luka to smile like that is the reaction he wanted from her, Luka whistles in her direction is feel like a cat call honestly, (let me just preface I don't think Luka has any genuine interest in Mizi) Luka starts singing/talking, \\\"You can turn away from the light, You even out burn the sun,...\\\" (Keep in mind the don't have a face mic like Till had so I believe these are words that Luka only wants Mizi to hear. I would say for this part focus less on how the lyrics where delivered vocally and more how we were shown them physically.) I think the Light/Sun is simultaneously referring to both himself and Sua. Himself since she quite literally just turned away from him and he is also a person that shines like the Sun a person that is idolized (by the aliens). Sua because she was Mizi's light, her universe, her everything. Saying Mizi outburned the sun is like a cruel way of saying, you out lived Sua. I think Luka knows exactly what Mizi and Sua's relationship was and he's using it to his advantage to make her mad, but I feel like he also know what she is going through. Continuing on, Luka reaches out from behind her brushing her hair and whispering in her ear (my star) smiling. Mizi is even more distressed than the first time and she pushes him off. 1/2\", \"Been awhile but amazing as always!\", \"You never fail to impress us. This was a very shocking and beautiful Video.

Why we're skipping round 4? Some people say that vivinos planned it, but for me the reason why we skip round 4 is that it's not important at all to the story. Luke's opponent from round 4 was just an extra so why would we care what happened from the round 4. Unlike with Ivan and the white hair guy(forgot his name) they also fought with an extra character but that's because their song has connect with the other singer who's watching them. E.g. white hair song is for mizi and ivan song is for the white hair guy. That's why we only see him fight in round 5 and not in round 4, because the opponent on that round hasn't anything do with the storyline.\", \"I like how a crowd become louder when Luka come up, make it clear that Luka is the one that control the audience.
